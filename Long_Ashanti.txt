Hello my name is Ashanti Long. My name is derived from Ghanaian culture  which mean "undefeated'. 
I am a junior at the College of Charleston and I getting my Bachelor and Science in Computer Science and Math.  
 I was born in Suffolk Virginia but raised in outside of Charlotte. I am huge fan of traveling and learning about new things.
 The world is so big and I am just a small dust in this universe.
 There is so many people, food, culture, beliefs, knowledge and places to understand so I am always looking forward to experience though things. I love watching anime, reading manga/webtoon, playing games, baking desserts and etc. I am looking forward to the semester with all of you and learning new things and changing my perspective about history and my ideas
