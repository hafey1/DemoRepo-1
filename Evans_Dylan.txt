Hello everyone! My name is Dylan Evans, like most people here I am a senior at CofC with a computer science major.
I enjoy playing video games in my freetime and over the winter break I visited my family up in Alaska.
I currently don't do much besides go to work and sit at home due to the pandemic so I spend most of my time watching tv or playing video games.
